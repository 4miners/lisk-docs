Lisk Test Network

## About the Test Network

The Lisk Test Network (Testnet) serves as a nonproduction blockchain for testing and validation of code changes. This alternative blockchain provides an environment for both users and developers to test Lisk functionality without needing to purchase any LSK.

## Connecting to Testnet

There are a few ways to connect to Testnet. First way is a Lisk wallet. The Lisk team provides a wallet here: https://testnet.lisk.io/

The second way is to install a copy of Lisk on your own system. Instructions for how to do this can be found here: https://lisk.io/documentation?i=lisk-docs/BinaryInstall 

The third way involves using API calls to a public wallet. This method is recommended for advanced users and developers. Documentation for using API calls can be found here: https://lisk.io/documentation?i=lisk-docs/APIReference

## Securing Testnet

Testnet is completely is in the hands of the 101 forging delegates. This means that it is up to the community to keep their own Lisk clients running in order to support the test blockchain. Securing Testnet is vital for the future of Lisk and anyone is welcome to participate.

Assisting with the security of Testnet can provide valuable experience for anyone wanting to run a Delegate on Mainnet
